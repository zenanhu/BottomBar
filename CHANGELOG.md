### 2.1.2

* Merged [#703](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/703) that allows controlling badge visibility for tabs that are active.

### 2.1.1

* A quick fix for a really critical bug that could affect some devices. More specifically, [this one.](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/625)

### 2.1.0

* Fixed a bug in the Badge positioning, causing the Badges to clip when there was many tabs.
* Fixed a bug where the lower portion of unselected titles were clipped off in fixed mode.
* Made changes to Badge restoration logic to fix [445](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/445). Credit goes to [@Kevinrob](https://github.com/Kevinrob) for reporting and helping to reproduce the issue.
* Fixed [#448](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/448), [#471](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/471), [#436](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/436) and [#591](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/591)
* Fixed a faulty behavior where the tabs' widths were calculated according to phone screen width, but should've been calculated according to the parent view's width by merging [#504](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/504) 
* Optimized the tab resizing calculations; now the tabs aren't needlessly removed and readded, only the layout params get changed.
* Merged [#468](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/468) and [#457](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/457)
* Fixed [#554](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/554) by merging [#512](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/512).
* Made most of the BottomBarTab methods public.

### 2.0.2

* Now we're animating the color change on tab titles and icons.
* Fixed a bug where the BottomBar wouldn't hide completely when it was both shy and drawing under navbar.
* Made possible to inflate the BottomBar programmatically.
* Made it possible to control whether the shadow is shown or not.
* Made setItems to be public to allow writing tests without a designated Activity
* Made setters for allowing setting tab colors, alphas, textappearances and typefaces programmatically.
* Increased test coverage a little bit.

### 2.0.1

* Fixed a bug where the tab selection listener is set and multiple tabs could be selected at once
* Fixed a bug where the reselection listener was fired even it shouldn't have.

### 2.0

* Cleaner code and better APIs
* No more unnecessary stuff or spaghetti mess
* Now the look, feel and behavior is defined in XML, as it should be
* No more nasty regressions, thanks to the automated tests
* **Everything is a little different compared to earlier, but it's for the greater good!**

See the readme for how to use the new version.

### 1.4.0.1

* Merged a [PR that fixes removing all tabs from BottomBar](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/339)

### 1.4.0

* Started writing some tests. **Contributions more than welcome**, as I'm still a noob when it comes to testing.
* Merged a [PR that adds support for vector drawables](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/280)
* Merged a [PR that adds support for disabling text scale animation](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/298)
* Merged a [PR that adds support for custom background and tab icon colors, and also custom alpha](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/302)
* Merged a [PR that fixes wrong method name for message shown by an exception](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/320)

### 1.3.9

* Merged [another PR that should get rid of the infinite Badge loop for good](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/289).

### 1.3.8

* Merged a [PR that fixes infinite loop caused by a layout listener when adding Badges.](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/286)

### 1.3.7

* Merged a [PR that fixes elliptical Badges](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/275).
* Fixed issues [#276](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/276) and [#277](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/277)

### 1.3.6

* Fixed a bug that would cause the navigation bar to not be transparent.
* Flattened View hierarchy.
* Throwing a nice little Exception if someone tries to call ```noResizeGoodness()``` improperly, instead of just failing silently.

### 1.3.5

* [Merged](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/260) [some](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/268) [pull](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/269) [requests.](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/271)
* Thanks to @henhal, now the unselection bug when using badges is fixed.
* Deprecated the ```setItemsFromMenu(@MenuRes int resId, OnMenuTabClickListener listener)``` method in favor of two separate methods: ```mBottomBar.setItems(@MenuRes int resId)``` and ```mBottomBar.setOnMenuTabClickListener(OnMenuTabClickListener listener)```. Not only because deprecating stuff is so fun (it is), but because this actually makes more sense than the old approach. The old approach still works.

### 1.3.4

* Now the BottomBar is 56dp tall, as it should be! Make sure your icons are 24dp and **trimmed**, meaning that the whole png size musn't be more than 24dp. So **don't use padding** around the icon.
* Fixed a minor bug when programmatically selecting a tab.
* Added a ```setAutoHideOnSelection(boolean autoHideOnSelection)``` method for the BottomBarBadge to control whether it is automatically hidden after the tab that contains it is selected or not. 
* Titles are now forced to be single line, make sure your title texts are short enough, or else they'll get truncated with a "..." !
* Updated some dependencies and Gradle.

### 1.3.3

* The show / hide methods now behave nicely with CoordinatorLayout.
* Added alpha animation for the tab titles when using the shifting tabs.

### 1.3.2

* Now it's possible to use fixed mode (show titles on inactive tabs) even when there's more than three tabs.

### 1.3.1

* Fixed a critical bug in OnLongClickListener behavior (why didn't I see that before?) when using badges.

### 1.3.0

* Fixed a critical bug in OnClickListener behavior when using badges.

### 1.2.9

* Fixed the issue when using badges and the tab resize animation is enabled. Now the badges automatically adjust their position when the tab's size (or position) updates.

### 1.2.8

* Fixed the [ugly layout bug](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/126) that happened when calling the ```setDefaultTabPosition()``` or ```selectTabAtPosition()``` methods.

### Versions 0.0.1 - 1.2.7

* Sweating my ass off making this library and trying to compete with the other ones.
